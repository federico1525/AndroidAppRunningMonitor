# AndroidAppRunningMonitor

### _A CommonJS module for Titanium mobile applications._

This module provides the ability for your Android application to know when it is running
and when it has been stopped. The term "running" means that at least one
Activity/Window is being displayed, whereas the term "stopped" means that
none of the Activities/Windows are being displayed.
